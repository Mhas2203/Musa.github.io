        <p> Hello! my name is Musa, continuous learner and a student at Normandale Community
            College. I enjoy programming and coding. Enthusiastic and determined
            student looking to utilize outstanding creative and critical thinking skills.
            I will be graduating in May 2026 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>With a collaborative mindset and strong communication abilities, I thrive in team environments and contribute
            to
            impactful projects.
            I'm actively exploring internship opportunities in the technical field to apply my education,
            enhance my skills, and contribute to my personal growth. My insatiable passion for learning motivates me to
            continually
            seek opportunities for expanding my knowledge and experience.
